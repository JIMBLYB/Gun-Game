## Pitch
We want to create an FPS free-for-all battle arena game for teenagers, in which six players are pitted against each other and tasked with getting the most kills. The weapons at the disposal of the players consist of two types: melee, and "plug-in". "plug in" weapons are ranged weapons with similar mechanics as other games - wherein you must collect ammo, which can be expended to shoot the weapon -, but will have the additional requirement of being plugged into mains power to operate, with a small charge being held for use while not plugged in. Melee weapons will work as they do in the majority of other games, and will consist of items that you can reasonably find on a construction site, which will be less powerful than the "plug-in" weapons, but have the benefit of free movement. There will also be upgrades scattered around the map which will give temporary benefits such as extension cords or generators to increase maneuverability or allow you to place plugs in more opportunistic places for a limited time. The art style will be rather cartoony, with the weapons being oversized and little detail past the amount required to recognise each thing
